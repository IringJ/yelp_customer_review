# yelp_customer_review

## Statement of the Research Problem 
Our team (group of four people) focused on exploring the relationship among users’ attributes and sentiment of customer review to help businesses accurately target customers’ preferences. According to a study by Harvard Business School assistant professor Michael Luca, a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue. Furthermore, “consumers rely on simple metrics such as the average rating and the number of reviews” and “consumers respond more strongly when a rating contains more information” (Luca, 2011). Thus, it is increasingly important for businesses to understand the users’ preferences on what specific characteristics they consider when given a high or low rating. 


## Research questions: 
1. What is the relationship between user attributes and user average rating? 
2. What is the relationship between the sentiment of customer review text on average rating?
